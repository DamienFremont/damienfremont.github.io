You’re tired of spring batch? the future JavaEE batch API  leaves you cold?  
I’m trying to make a basic implementation of batch, not dependent on any framework and compatible with SpringBatch extensions (if needed) and with the same service quality (batch structure, extensions like jdbc, jpa, file, message, etc).

It’s called SimpleBatch and it’s very cool indeed. With future fluent API.

if you have any need, or advice, please visit my GitHub project or post a comment here.
