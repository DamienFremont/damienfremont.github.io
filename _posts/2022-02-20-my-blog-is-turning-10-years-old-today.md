Today (20 February 2022) is a very meaningful and historic day for me as it marks the 10th anniversary of my blog here. A decade has gone since I browse through the web looking for a platform for blogging and then decided to join WordPress after Blogger.

## What I’ve Learned ?

This blog helped me a lot in my job. Motivate myself to learn on my own, then sharing knowledge with others.

## What’s Next ?

More products and less blogging!

Last but not least, Happy 10th Birthday to my blog once again!

Thank you all.
